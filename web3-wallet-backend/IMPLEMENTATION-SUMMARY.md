   - Publishes price update events to Kafka

### Infrastructure Components

1. **Redis**
   - Used for caching frequently accessed data
   - Configured for high availability with replication
   - Optimized for performance with connection pooling
   - Supports multi-region deployment with Redis Cluster

2. **Kafka**
   - Used for event streaming between services
   - Configured for high throughput and reliability
   - Supports multi-region replication with Mirror Maker
   - Optimized for performance with proper partitioning

3. **PostgreSQL**
   - Used for persistent storage
   - Configured for high availability with replication
   - Optimized for performance with connection pooling
   - Supports multi-region deployment with read replicas

4. **Kubernetes**
   - Used for container orchestration
   - Configured for high availability with multiple replicas
   - Supports auto-scaling based on CPU and memory usage
   - Enables multi-region deployment with separate clusters

### Multi-Region Architecture

The system is deployed across multiple regions to ensure high availability and low latency:

1. **Regional Components**
   - Each region has its own GKE cluster
   - Each region has its own Redis instance
   - Each region has its own Kafka cluster
   - Each region has its own PostgreSQL read replica

2. **Global Components**
   - Global load balancer routes traffic to the nearest healthy region
   - PostgreSQL primary instance with read replicas in each region
   - Kafka Mirror Maker replicates topics across regions
   - Failover mechanism automatically redirects traffic if a region fails

## High-Performance Features

### Caching Strategy

1. **Cache-Aside Pattern**
   - Check cache first, then database
   - Update cache after database operations
   - Use appropriate TTL for different types of data
   - Cache invalidation on updates and deletes

2. **Redis Optimization**
   - Connection pooling for efficient resource utilization
   - Pipelining for batch operations
   - Proper TTL for cache entries
   - Cluster mode for horizontal scaling

### Event Streaming

1. **Kafka Optimization**
   - Proper partitioning for parallel processing
   - Batch processing for high throughput
   - Message compression for network efficiency
   - Consumer groups for load balancing

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Asynchronous processing for better scalability
   - Decoupled services for independent scaling
   - Event sourcing for reliable state reconstruction
   - CQRS pattern for optimized read and write operations

### Service Optimization

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Multiple replicas for each service
   - Auto-scaling based on CPU and memory usage
   - Load balancing for even distribution of requests
   - Stateless design for easy scaling

2. **Resilience Patterns**
   - Circuit breakers for fault tolerance
   - Timeouts for preventing resource exhaustion
   - Retries with exponential backoff
   - Bulkheads for failure isolation

## Deployment and Operations

### Deployment

1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
   - Kubernetes manifests for service deployment
   - Helm charts for complex deployments
   - CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

2. **Multi-Region Deployment**
   - Separate GKE clusters in each region
   - Global load balancer for traffic routing
   - Regional failover for high availability
   - Consistent configuration across regions

### Monitoring and Observability

1. **Metrics**
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Grafana for visualization
   - Alerts for proactive monitoring
   - SLOs for service level objectives

2. **Logging and Tracing**
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs
