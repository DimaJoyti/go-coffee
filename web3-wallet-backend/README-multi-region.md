# Multi-Region High-Performance Web3 Wallet Backend

This document describes the multi-region, high-performance services implementation for the Web3 wallet backend system.

## Architecture Overview

The system is designed to be deployed across multiple regions to ensure high availability, low latency, and disaster recovery. Each region contains a complete set of services, including:

- Supply Service: Manages shopper supply
- Order Service: Manages orders
- Claiming Service: Manages order claiming

Each service is backed by:
- Redis for caching
- Kafka for event streaming
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage

## Multi-Region Design

### Regional Components

Each region contains:
1. GKE Cluster: Hosts all services
2. Redis Cluster: Provides caching for services
3. Kafka Cluster: Handles event streaming
4. Regional Load Balancer: Routes traffic within the region

### Global Components

1. Global Load Balancer: Routes traffic to the nearest healthy region
2. Multi-Region Database: Ensures data consistency across regions
3. Kafka Mirror Maker: Replicates Kafka topics across regions

## High-Performance Features

### Redis Caching

- Connection pooling for efficient resource utilization
- Read replicas for scaling read operations
- Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling
- Optimized TTL for cache entries
- Redis pipelining for batch operations

### Kafka Optimization

- Proper partitioning for parallel processing
- Batch processing for high throughput
- Message compression for network efficiency
- Optimized consumer groups for load balancing
- Kafka Streams for real-time processing

### Service Optimization

- Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes
- Circuit breakers for fault tolerance
- Connection pooling for database connections
- Proper timeouts and retries
- Metrics collection for performance monitoring

## Failover Mechanism

The system includes an automatic failover mechanism that:
1. Monitors the health of each region
2. Detects failures based on configurable thresholds
3. Redirects traffic to healthy regions
4. Recovers failed regions automatically

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Platform account
- Terraform 1.0+
- kubectl
- Helm 3+

### Deployment Steps

1. Configure Terraform variables:

```bash
cd terraform/multi-region
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your configuration
```

2. Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

3. Apply Terraform configuration:

```bash
terraform apply
```

4. Configure kubectl:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $(terraform output -raw primary_cluster_name) --region $(terraform output -raw primary_region)
```

5. Deploy services:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/manifests/
```

## Monitoring and Observability

The system includes comprehensive monitoring and observability features:

1. Prometheus for metrics collection
2. Grafana for visualization
3. Jaeger for distributed tracing
4. Structured logging with correlation IDs
5. Health checks for all services

## Scaling

The system can be scaled in multiple dimensions:

1. Vertical scaling: Increase resources for individual components
2. Horizontal scaling: Add more instances of services
3. Regional scaling: Add more regions for global coverage

## Security

The system includes multiple security features:

1. Network isolation with private GKE clusters
2. Service accounts with minimal permissions
3. Encryption in transit and at rest
4. Authentication and authorization for all services
5. Regular security updates
