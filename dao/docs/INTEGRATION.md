- ‚úÖ **Integration monitoring active**
- ‚úÖ **Event logging functional**
- ‚úÖ **Cross-service communication enabled**
- ‚úÖ **API endpoints responding**
- ‚úÖ **Health checks passing**

### Ecosystem Detection
The platform automatically detects and integrates with:
- **Main API Gateway** (port 8080) - Routes and service discovery
- **DeFi Service** (port 8090) - TVL and metrics synchronization
- **AI Agents** (port 8091) - Task creation and notifications

## üîÑ Integration Workflow

### 1. Service Startup
```bash
cd dao
./bin/simple-integrated-demo
```

### 2. Ecosystem Detection
- Platform scans for existing Go Coffee services
- Establishes connections where available
- Configures integration modes (full/standalone)

### 3. Event Broadcasting
- DAO events are logged and broadcast to ecosystem
- Integration events include bounty creation, proposal submission
- Metrics updates are synchronized across services

### 4. Health Monitoring
- Continuous health checks on all services
- Integration status updates every 30 seconds
- Automatic recovery and reconnection attempts

## üß™ Testing Integration

### Create a Bounty (with ecosystem notification)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/bounties \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Integration","description":"Test bounty creation","reward":1000}'
```

### Create a Proposal (with ecosystem notification)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/api/v1/proposals \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Proposal","description":"Test proposal creation"}'
