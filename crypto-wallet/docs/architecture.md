# Web3 Wallet Backend Architecture

This document provides a detailed overview of the Web3 Wallet Backend system architecture.

## System Overview

The Web3 Wallet Backend is designed as a microservices architecture to provide high availability, scalability, and maintainability. The system is composed of several independent services that communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces.

## System Components

### API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests. It handles:

- Authentication and authorization
- Request routing to appropriate services
- Rate limiting
- CORS handling
- Request/response logging
- Error handling

The API Gateway exposes a RESTful API for external clients and communicates with the internal services using gRPC.

### Wallet Service

The Wallet Service manages all wallet-related operations, including:

- Wallet creation
- Wallet import/export
- Balance checking
- Key management

The Wallet Service stores wallet metadata in the database and securely manages private keys using the Security Service.

### Transaction Service

The Transaction Service handles all transaction-related operations, including:

- Transaction creation
- Transaction status tracking
- Gas estimation
- Gas price retrieval
- Transaction receipt retrieval

The Transaction Service interacts with various blockchain networks to submit and track transactions.

### Smart Contract Service

The Smart Contract Service manages all smart contract-related operations, including:

- Contract deployment
- Contract method calls
- Contract event monitoring
- Token information retrieval

The Smart Contract Service interacts with various blockchain networks to deploy and interact with smart contracts.

### Security Service

The Security Service provides security-related operations, including:

- Key pair generation
- Private key encryption/decryption
- JWT token generation/verification
- Mnemonic phrase generation/validation
- Mnemonic to private key conversion

The Security Service ensures that sensitive cryptographic operations are performed securely.

## Communication Patterns

### External Communication

External clients communicate with the system through the API Gateway using RESTful HTTP APIs. The API Gateway authenticates requests, performs authorization checks, and routes requests to the appropriate internal services.

### Internal Communication

Internal services communicate with each other using gRPC, which provides:

- Efficient binary serialization
- Strong typing through Protocol Buffers
- Bidirectional streaming
- Built-in load balancing and service discovery

## Data Flow

### Wallet Creation Flow

1. Client sends a request to create a wallet to the API Gateway
2. API Gateway authenticates the request and routes it to the Wallet Service
3. Wallet Service requests the Security Service to generate a key pair
4. Security Service generates a key pair and returns it to the Wallet Service
5. Wallet Service creates a wallet record in the database
6. Wallet Service returns the wallet details to the API Gateway
7. API Gateway returns the wallet details to the client

### Transaction Creation Flow

1. Client sends a request to create a transaction to the API Gateway
2. API Gateway authenticates the request and routes it to the Transaction Service
3. Transaction Service retrieves the wallet details from the Wallet Service
4. Transaction Service requests the Security Service to decrypt the private key
5. Security Service decrypts the private key and returns it to the Transaction Service
6. Transaction Service creates and signs the transaction
7. Transaction Service submits the transaction to the blockchain
8. Transaction Service creates a transaction record in the database
9. Transaction Service returns the transaction details to the API Gateway
10. API Gateway returns the transaction details to the client

## Database Schema

The system uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main tables:

- `users`: Stores user information
- `wallets`: Stores wallet metadata
- `transactions`: Stores transaction details
- `contracts`: Stores smart contract metadata
- `contract_events`: Stores smart contract events

## Security Model

### Authentication

The system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. The Security Service generates and verifies JWT tokens.

### Authorization

The system implements role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users can only access resources they are authorized to access.

### Key Management

Private keys are never stored in plaintext. The Security Service encrypts private keys before they are stored, and decrypts them only when needed for signing transactions.

### Secure Communication

All external communication is secured using TLS. Internal communication between services can be secured using mTLS (mutual TLS) in production environments.

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

Each service can be horizontally scaled independently based on load. The API Gateway and service discovery mechanisms ensure that requests are distributed across available instances.

### Database Scaling

The database can be scaled using read replicas for read-heavy operations and sharding for write-heavy operations.

### Caching

The system uses Redis for caching frequently accessed data, such as wallet balances and transaction statuses.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks

Each service exposes a health check endpoint that can be used by load balancers and monitoring systems to check the health of the service.

### Metrics

Each service exposes metrics that can be collected by Prometheus and visualized using Grafana.

### Logging

The system uses structured logging with correlation IDs to track requests across services.

### Tracing

The system can be configured to use distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) to track requests across services.

## Deployment Architecture

### Docker Deployment

The system can be deployed using Docker Compose for development and testing environments.

### Kubernetes Deployment

For production environments, the system can be deployed on Kubernetes, which provides:

- Automated scaling
- Self-healing
- Rolling updates
- Service discovery
- Load balancing

### Cloud Provider Deployment

The system can be deployed on various cloud providers, including:

- AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
- Azure (Microsoft Azure)

## Future Considerations

### Multi-Chain Support

The system is designed to support multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. Additional networks can be added by implementing the appropriate blockchain clients.

### Layer 2 Solutions

The system can be extended to support Layer 2 solutions, such as Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups, to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs.

### Cross-Chain Operations

The system can be extended to support cross-chain operations, such as token bridges and atomic swaps, to enable interoperability between different blockchain networks.
