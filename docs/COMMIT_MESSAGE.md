## Summary
Comprehensive fix for all failing CI/CD pipeline jobs with improved reliability, security, and maintainability.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed
- ✅ Lint and Security Scan failures
- ✅ Unit Tests failures  
- ✅ Integration Tests failures
- ✅ Docker Build and Test issues
- ✅ Module dependency conflicts
- ✅ Missing test files and Dockerfiles

## 🏗️ Major Changes

### Workflow Restructure
- Split monolithic job into focused, parallel jobs
- Added proper job dependencies and conditional execution
- Improved error handling and reporting

### Dependencies & Modules
- Fixed Go module dependency conflicts
- Added proper replace directives for local packages
- Updated to Go 1.24 and latest GitHub Actions

### Testing Infrastructure

## 📁 Files Added/Modified

### New Files
- `main.go` - Root module entry point
- `main_test.go` - Basic tests for CI
- `cmd/kitchen-service/Dockerfile` - Missing Dockerfile
- `scripts/test-ci-pipeline.sh` - Local testing script
- `scripts/validate-ci-setup.sh` - Setup validation
- `docs/CI-CD-PIPELINE-FIXES-COMPLETE.md` - Complete documentation

### Modified Files
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml` - Complete workflow overhaul
- `.golangci.yml` - Simplified linting configuration
- `go.mod` - Fixed module dependencies with replace directives

## 🎯 Expected Results
- All CI/CD jobs should now pass successfully
- Improved build times with parallel execution
- Better security posture with comprehensive scanning
- Reliable deployment process to staging environment

## 🧪 Testing
Run local validation:
```bash
./scripts/validate-ci-setup.sh
./scripts/test-ci-pipeline.sh
```

## 📋 Next Steps
