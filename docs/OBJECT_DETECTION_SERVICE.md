# Object Detection Service

A real-time object detection system built in Go that can identify and track different objects in video streams using machine learning models.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Multiple Video Sources**: Support for webcam, file, RTMP, and HTTP video streams
- **WebSocket Streaming**: Real-time detection results via WebSocket connections
- **REST API**: Complete API for stream management, detection control, and data retrieval
- **Model Management**: Upload, activate, and manage different detection models
- **Alert System**: Configurable alerts for specific object detections
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and observability

### Architecture
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics
The service exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`:
- HTTP request metrics (duration, count, status codes)
- Stream processing metrics (FPS, frame count, errors)
- Detection metrics (objects detected, processing time)
- System metrics (memory, CPU, goroutines)

### Logging
Structured logging with configurable levels:
- JSON format for production
- Human-readable for development
- Request correlation IDs
- Performance tracking

### Health Checks
- `/health` - Basic service health
- `/ready` - Dependency readiness (DB, Redis, models)

## Deployment

### Docker
```bash
# Build image
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.object-detection -t object-detection-service .

# Run container
docker run -p 8080:8080 object-detection-service
```

### Kubernetes
Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests available in `/k8s` directory.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips
1. **GPU Acceleration**: Enable GPU support for faster inference
2. **Frame Dropping**: Configure frame rate limits for real-time performance
3. **Batch Processing**: Use batch inference for multiple streams
4. **Memory Management**: Monitor memory usage with large video files
5. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database and Redis connections

### Scaling
- Horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Stream distribution across instances
- Shared model storage
- Redis clustering for high availability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **OpenCV Installation**: Ensure OpenCV is properly installed with video codecs
2. **Model Loading**: Check model file paths and formats
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption with large models
4. **Performance**: Adjust confidence thresholds and input sizes

### Debug Mode
```bash
ENVIRONMENT=development LOG_LEVEL=debug ./object-detection-service
```
