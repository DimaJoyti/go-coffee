## 🏗️ Architecture Transformation

### Before Phase 1 (Gin-based)
```
Go Coffee Platform (Gin Framework)
├── User Gateway (gin.Engine)
├── Security Gateway (gin.Engine)
├── Web UI Backend (gin.Engine)
├── Complex Gin middleware chains
├── gin.Context dependencies
└── gin-contrib packages
```

### After Phase 1 (Clean Architecture)
```
Go Coffee Platform (Clean Architecture)
├── User Gateway (gorilla/mux + Clean HTTP)
├── Security Gateway (gorilla/mux + Clean HTTP)
├── Web UI Backend (gorilla/mux + Clean HTTP)
├── Standard HTTP middleware
├── http.Request/ResponseWriter
└── Clean separation of concerns
```

## 📊 Migration Statistics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Framework Dependencies | 3x Gin | 3x gorilla/mux | Simplified |
| Handler Signatures | gin.Context | http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request | Standard |
| Middleware Complexity | High (Gin-specific) | Low (Standard HTTP) | Reduced |
| Build Size | Larger (Gin overhead) | Smaller (No Gin) | Optimized |
| Performance | Good | Better | Improved |
| Testability | Gin-dependent | Standard HTTP | Enhanced |
