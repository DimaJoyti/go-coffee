# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document contains answers to frequently asked questions about the Coffee Order System.

## General Questions

### What is the Coffee Order System?

The Coffee Order System is an application that allows customers to place coffee orders through an API. The system uses Kafka for asynchronous order processing.

### What components make up the system?

The system consists of two main components:
1. **Producer Service**: An HTTP server that receives orders from clients and publishes them to Kafka.
2. **Consumer Service**: A service that consumes orders from Kafka and processes them.

### What technologies are used in the system?

The system uses the following technologies:

- **Go (Golang)**: The programming language used for both services.
- **Kafka**: The streaming platform for message exchange between services.
- **Sarama**: A Go library for interacting with Kafka.
- **HTTP**: The protocol for the API.

## Installation and Configuration

### What are the system requirements?

To run the system, you need:

- Go 1.22 or higher
- Kafka 2.8.0 or higher
- Docker (optional, for running Kafka)

### How do I install the system?

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coffee-order-system.git
   cd coffee-order-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Producer
   cd producer
   go mod tidy

   # Consumer
   cd ../consumer
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Start Kafka:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name kafka \
     -p 9092:9092 \
     -e KAFKA_CFG_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:2181 \
     -e ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_LISTENER=yes \
     bitnami/kafka
   ```

4. Start the services:

   ```bash
   # Producer
   cd producer
   go run main.go

   # Consumer
   cd ../consumer
   go run main.go
   ```

### How do I configure the system?

The system can be configured through environment variables or a configuration file. For more details, see [Configuration](configuration.md).

## Using the API

### How do I place an order?

To place an order, send a POST request to `/order` with a JSON body:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/order \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customer_name":"John Doe","coffee_type":"Latte"}'
```

### What fields are required for an order?

An order must contain the following fields:

- `customer_name`: The customer's name
- `coffee_type`: The type of coffee

### How do I check the system status?

To check the system status, send a GET request to `/health`:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/health
```

## Development and Extension

### How do I add a new endpoint?

1. Add a new method to the `Handler` struct in `producer/handler/handler.go`.
2. Register the endpoint in `producer/main.go`.
3. Add tests for the new endpoint.

For more details, see the [Development Guide](development-guide.md).

### How do I add a new field to an order?

1. Update the `Order` struct in `producer/handler/handler.go` and `consumer/main.go`.
2. Update the validation in `producer/handler/handler.go`.
3. Update the processing in `consumer/main.go`.

### How do I change the Kafka topic?

The Kafka topic can be changed through the `KAFKA_TOPIC` environment variable or through the configuration file.

## Performance and Scaling

### How many requests can the system handle?

The system's performance depends on many factors, including hardware, Kafka configuration, and processing complexity. In a basic configuration, the system can handle several hundred requests per second.

### How do I scale the system?

The system can be scaled horizontally by running multiple instances of the Producer Service and Consumer Service. To do this:

1. Increase the number of partitions in the Kafka topic.
2. Run multiple instances of the Producer Service behind a load balancer.
3. Run multiple instances of the Consumer Service.

### How do I improve the system's performance?

To improve the system's performance, you can:

1. Optimize Kafka settings.
2. Implement asynchronous publishing to Kafka.
3. Implement connection pooling.
4. Implement caching.

For more details, see [Performance](performance.md).

## Security

### Does the system support authentication?

Currently, the system does not support authentication. This is planned for future versions.

### Does the system support HTTPS?

Currently, the system does not support HTTPS. This is planned for future versions.

### How do I protect the API from attacks?

To protect the API from attacks, it is recommended to:

1. Configure HTTPS.
2. Implement authentication and authorization.
3. Add rate limiting.
4. Configure a firewall.

For more details, see [Security](security.md).

## Troubleshooting

### The system doesn't start. What should I do?

1. Check if Kafka is running.
2. Check the Kafka connection settings.
3. Check the logs for errors.

### Orders are not being processed. What should I do?

1. Check if the Consumer Service is running.
2. Check if the Kafka topic is correctly configured.
3. Check the logs for errors.

### How do I get more information about an error?

To get more information about an error, check the logs of the Producer Service and Consumer Service.

## Support and Feedback

### How do I get support?

To get support:

1. Check the documentation.
2. Check the FAQ.
3. Open an issue on GitHub.

### How do I report a bug?

To report a bug, open an issue on GitHub with a detailed description of the bug, steps to reproduce it, and expected behavior.

### How do I suggest a new feature?

To suggest a new feature, open an issue on GitHub with a detailed description of the feature, its purpose, and expected behavior.
