# Security Architecture - Go Coffee Platform

## Overview

The Go Coffee platform implements a comprehensive, enterprise-grade security architecture designed to protect against modern threats while maintaining high performance and user experience. Our security-first approach integrates multiple layers of protection across all microservices.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Security Gateway Service

The **Security Gateway** serves as the central security hub for all incoming requests.

#### Key Features:
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** - Protection against OWASP Top 10
- **Rate Limiting** - Distributed rate limiting with Redis backend
- **API Gateway** - Secure request routing and load balancing
- **Real-time Threat Detection** - ML-powered threat analysis
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive request sanitization
- **Security Headers** - HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options enforcement

#### Security Checks:
```
Request → Rate Limit → WAF → Input Validation → Auth → Authorization → Backend Service
```

### 2. Enhanced Authentication & Authorization

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **TOTP** - Time-based One-Time Passwords (Google Authenticator)

```
Risk Score = Σ(Indicator Weight × Confidence)
```

Risk Levels:
